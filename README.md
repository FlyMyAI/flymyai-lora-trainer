## 📁 Data Preparation

### Dataset Structure

The training data should follow the same format as Flux LoRA training, where each image has a corresponding text file with the same name:

```
dataset/
├── img1.png
├── img1.txt
├── img2.jpg
├── img2.txt
├── img3.png
├── img3.txt
└── ...
```

### Data Format Requirements

1. **Images**: Support common formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP)
2. **Text files**: Plain text files containing image descriptions
3. **File naming**: Each image must have a corresponding text file with the same base name

### Example Data Structure

```
my_training_data/
├── portrait_001.png
├── portrait_001.txt
├── landscape_042.jpg
├── landscape_042.txt
├── abstract_design.png
├── abstract_design.txt
└── style_reference.jpg
└── style_reference.txt
```

### Text File Content Examples

**portrait_001.txt:**
```
A realistic portrait of a young woman with brown hair, natural lighting, professional photography style
```

**landscape_042.txt:**
```
Mountain landscape at sunset, dramatic clouds, golden hour lighting, wide angle view
```

**abstract_design.txt:**
```
Modern abstract art with geometric shapes, vibrant colors, minimalist composition
```

### Data Preparation Tips

1. **Image Quality**: Use high-resolution images (recommended 1024x1024 or higher)
2. **Description Quality**: Write detailed, accurate descriptions of your images
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent style and quality across your dataset
4. **Dataset Size**: For good results, use at least 10-50 image-text pairs
5. **Trigger Words**: If training on a specific concept, include consistent trigger words in descriptions
6. **Auto-generate descriptions**: You can generate image descriptions automatically using [Florence-2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gokaygokay/Florence-2)

### Quick Data Validation

You can verify your data structure using the included validation utility:

```bash
python utils/validate_dataset.py --path path/to/your/dataset
```

This will check that:
- Each image has a corresponding text file
- All files follow the correct naming convention
- Report any missing files or inconsistencies

---

## 🏁 Start Training

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_lora.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora.yaml
```

Make sure `train_lora.yaml` is correctly set up with paths to your dataset, model, output directory, and other parameters.
## 🧪 Usage

---
### 🔧 Initialization

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)
```

### 🔌 Load LoRA Weights

```python
# Load LoRA weights
pipe.load_lora_weights('flymy-ai/qwen-image-realism-lora', adapter_name="lora")
```

### 🎨 Generate Image with lora trained on person
You can find LoRA weights [here](https://huggingface.co/flymy-ai/qwen-image-realism-lora)

No trigger word required
```python
prompt = '''Super Realism portrait of a teenager woman of African descent, serene calmness, arms crossed, illuminated by dramatic studio lighting, sunlit park in the background, adorned with delicate jewelry, three-quarter view, sun-kissed skin with natural imperfections, loose shoulder-length curls, slightly squinting eyes, environmental street portrait with text "FLYMY AI" on t-shirt.'''
negative_prompt =  " "
image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=1024,
    height=1024,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=5,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(346346)
)

# Display the image (in Jupyter or save to file)
image.show()
# or
image.save("output.png")
```
